Directions:
Download Git, Webstorm, and Github to your machine. 
Link personal or academic account to Github and Webstorm through system preferances and account settings.
Locate git.exe path through the command line on your machine. (Terminal for MacOS).
Add git.exe path and GitHub account to Webstorm system preferences. 
Now, Git and GitHub should be fully integrated to your machine and Webstorm. 
How Git and GitHub works: 
There are repositories you can create or import in GitHub. These repositories can be spit up or composed of branches, the main branch is the one where all the commits are pulled into upon completion.
In order to avoid conflicts and have two editors for one repository, you can clone a remote repository and commit your individual changes as you progress. Then, when you want to send your local commits to the main branch, you push.  
Reversely, you can pull changes from the remote repository to update your local repository with the pull feature. Merges take change from one branch into another, merge conflicts occur when there is an issue in combining the two branches.
